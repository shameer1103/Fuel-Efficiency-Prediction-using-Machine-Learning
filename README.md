# Fuel Efficiency Prediction using Machine Learning

A project to predict vehicle fuel efficiency using a Random Forest Regressor. 
Key tasks include data preprocessing, outlier removal, feature encoding, and model evaluation (RÂ² Score: 0.90). 
The model was deployed using Streamlit with a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
